Estimating Causal Effects of Innovative Treatments for Lower Grade Glioma Using Multinomial BAR

The goal of this project is to analyze the causal effect of innovative treatments (targeted molecular therapy and radiation treatment) on the treatment outcomes for patients with LGG. We aim to estimate the treatment effect on the ordinal outcome (PD, PR/SD, CR) using a multinomial approach, specifically employing Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) and Bayesian Sequential Regression (bayesreg)
